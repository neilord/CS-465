# Travlr Getaways - Full Stack Web Application (CS-465)

This repository contains the full stack web application for Travlr Getaways, developed as part of the CS-465 course at SNHU. The project is built on the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) and features a public, server-side rendered customer website and a secure, client-side single-page application (SPA) for administrators.
